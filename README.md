# angulpify-es6-seed
Made as a starting point for some bleeding edge  projects.
Using es6 via 6to5, broswerify and gulp based build chain and ofcourse Angular

this project was started by using yeoman [generator angulpify](https://github.com/jgoux/generator-angulpify)
I then added 6to5ify transform and converted example code to es6.
I plan to further improve this starting point and then re-convert into a yeoman generator.
