# angulpify-es6-seed
Made as a seed for some bleeding edge  projects.
Using es6 via 6to5, broswerify and gulp based build chain , Angular+react based app.

this project was started by using yeoman [generator angulpify](https://github.com/jgoux/generator-angulpify)
the following points were changed from the generator original resulting seed:
- converted all app code to es6, use 6to5 in building stage
- add testing using karma
- add react and ngreact to allow high performance react components in view level yet keep the angular structure
- refactot grunt tasks, specifically improve the browserify/watchify tasks - converged into one for easy managment
 

I plan to further improve this seed and then re-convert into a yeoman/SLUSH generator.
